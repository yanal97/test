Many schools in the coastal area of Aceh, Indonesia, were either totally destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami on December 26, 2004. There's also volatility, of a different kind, on Aceh's west-coast highway, a lifeline for reconstruction aid. Such a Web-based model, McKinnie said, sets a common framework for inundation modeling in the region and also addresses national restrictions on the use of sensitive bathymetric (measuring the sea bottom along the coast) and similar data for inundation modeling and mapping -- one of the most serious obstacles to modeling and mapping in the region. Early prospects are favorable for 2002/03 winter grains, with adequate winter precipitation recharging soil-moisture reserves. Normally, insect numbers tend to remain low and largely un-noticed, but when changes occur in the environment, such as weather changes or the food balance, or changes in the pest/natural enemy balance, or even due to some forms of human interference, insect populations can explode suddenly to give rise to what happened recently in Liberia with these caterpillars.
